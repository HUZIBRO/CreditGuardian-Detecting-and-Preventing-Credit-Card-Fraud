# CreditGuardian-Detecting-and-Preventing-Credit-Card-Fraud

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a credit card dataset, focusing on identifying spending patterns, customer behavior, and fraudulent transaction risks. It further applies supervised machine learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models. The notebook demonstrates expertise in data manipulation, visualization, and model evaluation using Python.
